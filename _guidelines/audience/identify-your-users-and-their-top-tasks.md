sidenav: guidelines

Think about how well your website allows customers to get something done.

- Customers come to your site to perform a task.
- They come because they expect to get self-service.

People come to your website with a specific task in mind. If your website doesn't help them complete that task, they'll leave.

You need to identify the mission – the purpose – of your website, to help you clarify the top task your website should help people accomplish.

In order to write for your users, you need to know who they are! Here are some general tips to help you identify your users:

- Listen to user questions – what do your visitors ask when they send you an email or call your office?
- Talk to users and ask them what they want.
- Analyze your web metrics to figure out what people are looking for on your website:

  - What are your most-visited pages and where do people spend the most time?
  - What top search phrases do people use?
