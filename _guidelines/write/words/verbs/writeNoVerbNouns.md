Use the strongest, most direct form of the verb possible.

Verbs are the fuel of writing. Verbs give your sentences power and direction. They enliven your writing and make it more interesting. Too often, we hide verbs by turning them into nouns, making them less effective and using more words than we need. Hidden verbs are a particular problem in government writing.

## What are hidden verbs?

A hidden verb is a verb converted into a noun. It often needs an extra verb to make sense. So we write, "Please make an application for a personal loan" rather than "Please apply for a personal loan."

Hidden verbs come in two forms. Some have endings such as _-ment_, _-tion_, _-sion_, and _-ance_ or link with verbs such as _achieve_, _effect_, _give_, _have_, _make_, _reach_, and _take_. Often, you will find a hidden verb between the words "the" and "of."
