Posting PDF versions (PDFs) of original documents on your site would seem to be an obvious alternative to rewriting your content in web format. Unfortunately, posting too many PDF documents on your website can work against your goal of retaining users. The Nielson group has done multiple studies on PDFs and has consistently found that users hate them and try to avoid reading PDFs at all costs.

PDF files:

- Are slow to open and can sometimes crash a computer if they’re too large
- Are difficult for some screen users to read
- Can make a user lose the website if they open in the same window

If you need to post a PDF use a gateway page – a web page that includes information about the PDF, including.

- What it's about
- How large the file is
- Who might find the information helpful

Remember to follow Section 508 guidelines when using PDFs. See [section508.gov](http://www.section508.gov) for more information about web accessibility.
