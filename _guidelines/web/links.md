Links are about both content and navigation. Effective link names are key to satisfying your customers. The Eyetracking Studies showed links written in plain-language were the most effective. Plain-language links are written clearly so that the user understands exactly where the link will take them.

- Link names should be the same as the page name linked to.
- Don't use the full name of a document or program as a link name.
- Be as explicit as you can-too long is better than too short.
- Make the link meaningful. Don't use "click here" or "more."
- Don't embed links in text. It just invites people to leave your text!
- Add a short description when needed to clarify the link.

Remember, some of your users might be visually disabled. Do not use "Click Here" or "Click the green button" links. Make sure your links are accessible to all users. You want to use links that clearly explain the content of the page it links to. If your link says "Annual Reports," then destination page must be titled "Annual Reports."
