title: Use "must" to indicate requirements
sidenav: guidelines
---

The word "must" is the clearest way to convey to your audience that they have to do something. "Shall" is one of those officious and obsolete words that has encumbered legal style writing for many years. The message that "shall" sends to the audience is, "this is deadly material." "Shall" is also obsolete. When was the last time you heard it used in everyday speech?

Besides being outdated, "shall" is imprecise. It can indicate either an obligation or a prediction. Dropping "shall" is a major step in making your document more user-friendly. Don't be intimidated by the argument that using "must" will lead to a lawsuit. Many agencies already use the word "must" to convey obligations. The US Courts are eliminating "shall" in favor of "must" in their Rules of Procedure. One example of these rules is cited below.

Instead of using "shall", use:

- "must" for an obligation
- "must not" for a prohibition
- "may" for a discretionary action
- "should" for a recommendation

The following example demonstrates how much clearer language can be if you follow these suggestions.
