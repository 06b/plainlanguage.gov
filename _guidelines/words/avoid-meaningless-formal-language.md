Many government websites and letters contain meaningless formal language such as flowery welcome messages and "we hope you get a lot out of our program" messages. Using this type of language wastes space and your users' time. It conveys the impression that you are insincere. Don't waste your users' time. Instead, get directly to the point. Remember, time is money on the web. Keep your important information at the top of a web page. Don't bury it under fluff messages.

Here is a brief list of meaningless filler phrases:

- Thinking outside the box
- Value added
- Best practice
- For all intents and purposes
- Touch base
- Integrating quality solutions
- Promoting an informed and inclusive multicultural society
- Strategically engaging schools, community organizations, and so on ...
