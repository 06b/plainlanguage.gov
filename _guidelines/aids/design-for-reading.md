We want our writing to help people get information, comply with requirements, and apply for benefits with the least possible burden. Dense, cluttered writing deters people from taking the time to read.

We've heard from many readers that when they get a dense, uninviting letters or notices from the government, they often put it in the "read later" pile, even though they know they should read it right away.

Designing for reading is an important part of developing effective communications. Writing that legible and well-organized is far easier to understand than more traditional styles.

Even with regulations and the limits of publishing in the Code of Federal Regulations, you can use design elements to help users read and understand the information. For example, you may want to:

- [highlight important concepts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guidelines/aids/highlight-important-concepts.md %})
- [use lists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guidelines/organize/use-lists.md %}) to outline steps in a process
- [add useful headings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guidelines/organize/add-useful-headings.md %}) to help people skim and scan the page
- [use tables]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guidelines/aids/use-tables-to-make-complex-material-easier-to-understand.md %}) to make complex material easier to understand

[Short sentences]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guidelines/concise/write-short-sentences.md %}) and [short sections]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guidelines/concise/write-short-sections.md %}) will also break up a regulation into manageable chunks. You will help your audience by making the main points readily apparent and grouping related items together. The easier it is for your audience to get through the regulation, the more likely it is they will comply with its requirements.

Here are a few more guidelines to help you design for reading:

- Limit the page to five or six sections (about two per printed page)
- Use lists and tables often, but don't overuse them and don't have lists within lists
- Use ragged right margins where possible, rather than centering or justifying your text
- Donâ€™t use more than one or two typefaces
