Remember that even though your document may affect a thousand or a million people, you are speaking to the one person who is reading it. When your writing reflects this, it's more economical and has a greater impact.

Singular nouns and verbs prevent confusion about whether a requirement applies to individual users or to groups. In the following example, the user might think that each applicant must file applications at several offices.

Confusing plural                                                                                                       | Clearer singular
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------
Individuals and organizations wishing to apply must file applications with the appropriate offices in a timely manner. | You must apply at least 30 days before you need the certification.

1. If you are an individual, apply at the State office in the State where you reside.
2. If you are an organization, apply at the State office in the State where your headquarters is located.

In addressing a single person, you can avoid awkwardness by using "you" to address the reader directly, rather than using "he or she" or "his or her."

Confusing plural                                                                            | Clearer singular
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------
The applicant must provide his or her mailing address and his or her identification number. | You must provide your mailing address and identification number.
