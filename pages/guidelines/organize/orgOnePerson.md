	<p>Remember that even though your document may affect a thousand or a million people, you are speaking to the one person who is reading it. When your writing reflects this, it's more economical and has a greater impact.</p>
<p>Singular nouns and verbs prevent confusion about whether a requirement applies to individual users or to groups. In the following example, the user might think that each applicant must file applications at several offices.</p>


	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="Example for clarification">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">Confusing plural</th>
				<th scope="col">Clearer singular</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%" valign="top">Individuals and organizations wishing to apply must file applications with the appropriate offices in a timely manner.</p></td>
				<td valign="top">You must apply at least 30 days before you need the certification.
					<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
						<li>If you are an individual, apply at the State office in the State where you reside.</li>
						<li>If you are an organization, apply at the State office in the State where your headquarters is located.</li>
					</ol>

	<p>In addressing a single person, you can avoid awkwardness by using &ldquo;you&rdquo; to address the reader directly, rather than using &ldquo;he or she&rdquo; or &ldquo;his or her.&rdquo;</p>
