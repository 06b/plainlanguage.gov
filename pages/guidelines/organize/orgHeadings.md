	<p>The best-organized document will still be difficult for users to follow if they can't see how it's organized. An effective way to reveal your document's organization is to use lots of useful headings. Headings are also critical for effective web pages (see <a href="webWrite.cfm">Writing for the web</a>). You should use headings liberally on the web to help your user accomplish top tasks.</p>

	<h2>Types of headings</h2>

	<p>There are three types of headings&mdash;</p>

	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="Three types of headings">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">Type of heading</th>
				<th scope="col">What it is</th>
				<th scope="col">How it looks</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Question Heading</td>
				<td>A heading in the form of a question</td>
				<td>Why Do We Use Headings?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Statement Heading</td>
				<td>A heading that uses a noun and a verb</td>
				<td>Headings Help Guide a Reader</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Topic Heading</td>
				<td>A heading that is a word or short phrase</td>
				<td>Headings</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p><strong><em>Question Headings</em></strong> are the most useful type of heading, but only if you know what questions your audience would ask. Most people come to government documents with questions.  If you know those questions, use them as headings.  They will help the audience find the information they are looking for quickly. Using the question-and-answer format helps your audience scan the document and find specific information.</p>
<p><strong><em>Statement Headings</em></strong> are the next best choice because they are still very specific.</p>
<p><strong><em>Topic Headings</em></strong> are the most formal; many times management is more comfortable with them. But sometimes they're so vague that they just aren't helpful. Topic Headings such as "General," "Application," and "Scope" are so vague they may confuse the user. For example, "Application" might mean an application to your agency from someone reading your document. But it might as easily mean what the document applies to.</p>


	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="Example of using informative Statement Headings">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">Short headings that aren&rsquo;t very helpful to the reader</th>
				<th scope="col">Informative headings capture the reader&rsquo;s questions</th>

	<p>In the example above, the section headings in the right column are more informative than the short topic headings in the left column. Additionally, breaking the material into more sections allows us to capture the entire content of each section in its heading. A document with lots of informative headings is easy to follow because the headings break up the material into logical, understandable pieces.  </p>

	<h2>Use headings to help develop your document's structure</h2>

	<p>It's often useful to start writing your document by developing the headings, structuring them to your audience's concerns. This approach can also reveal major groupings of information that you might want to identify with centered headings.</p>

	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="Use headings to help develop your document's structure">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">Broad topic headings are the first step in organizing the document</th>
				<th scope="col">Specific topics add the second level of organization</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>Qualifications of permittees and lessees</strong></td>
				<td>
					<ul style="list-style-type:none; margin-left:0;">
						<li>Who may hold leases and permits?</li>
						<li>Can foreign citizens hold permits or leases?</li>
						<li>How do I file evidence of my qualifications?</li>
						<li>Can I amend my qualifications statement?</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>Bonding requirements</strong></td>
				<td>
					<ul style="list-style-type:none; margin-left:0;">
						<li>Must I file a bond with my permit or lease?</li>
						<li>Where do I file my bond?</li>
						<li>What types of bonds are acceptable?</li>
						<li>How does BLM establish bond amounts?</li>
						<li>When does BLM terminate my liability under a bond?</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<h2>Headings can be too long</h2>

	<p>Headings should not be so long that they overwhelm the material in the section itself. Avoid headings with one-word answers. With rare exceptions, headings should be shorter than the content that follows them.</p>

	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="Headings can be too long">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">Heading overwhelms content</th>
				<th scope="col">Content should be longer than headings</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p><strong>Do I have to file a newspaper notice of my activities before I begin operations?</strong></p>
					<p>Yes.</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p><strong>Must I publish a public notice?</strong></p>
					<p>You must publish a notice of your operations in a local newspaper before you begin.</p>
				</td>
