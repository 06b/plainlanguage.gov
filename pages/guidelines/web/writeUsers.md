Think about how well your website allows customers to get something done.

- Customers come to your site to perform a task.
- They come because they expect to get self-service.

People come to your website with a specific task in mind. If your website doesn't help them complete that task, they'll leave.

You need to identify the mission – the purpose – of your website, to help you clarify the top task your website should help people accomplish.
