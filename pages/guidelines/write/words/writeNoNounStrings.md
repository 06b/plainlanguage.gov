	<p>The bulk of government and technical writing uses too many noun strings - groups of nouns "sandwiched" together. Readability suffers when three words that are ordinarily separate nouns follow in succession. Once you get past three, the string becomes unbearable. Technically, clustering nouns turns all but the last noun into adjectives. However, many users will think they've found the noun when they're still reading adjectives, and will become confused.</p>
<p>Bring these constructions under control by eliminating descriptive words that aren't essential. If you can't do that, open up the construction by using more prepositions and articles to clarify the relationships among the words.</p>
