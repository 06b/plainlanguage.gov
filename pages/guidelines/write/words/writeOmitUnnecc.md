	<p>Wordy, dense construction is one of the biggest problems in government writing. Nothing is more confusing to the user than long, complex sentences containing multiple phrases and clauses. Unnecessary words come in all shapes and sizes, and it's difficult to put them into distinct categories. To address the problem, writers must become more critical of their own writing. They must consider whether they need every word.</p>
<p>Unnecessary words waste your audience's time on the web as well. Remember great web content is like a conversation. Omit information that the audience doesn't need to know. This can be difficult as a subject matter expert so it is important to have someone look at the information from the audience's perspective.  (See <a href="writeWeb.cfm">Write web content</a> for more information on writing for the web.)</p>
<p>One place to start working on this problem in your own writing is to watch out for "of," "to," "on," and other <em><strong>prepositions</strong></em>. They often mark phases you can reduce to one or two words.

	<p>Often, you can omit <strong><em>redundant words</em></strong>.</p>

	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="Example for clarification">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">Don&rsquo;t say</th>
				<th scope="col">Say</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%">The X Department and the Y Department worked together on a joint project to improve &hellip;</td>
				<td>The X and Y Departments worked on a project to improve &hellip;</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>In this statement, you don't need "joint." You don't even need "together." Saying that X and Y worked on a project says it all. "Joint" and "together" are both redundant.</p>
<p>Similarly, we often use <strong>excess modifiers</strong> such as <em>absolutely</em>, <em>actually</em>, <em>completely</em>, <em>really</em>, <em>quite</em>, <em>totally</em>, and <em>very</em>. But if you look closely, you'll find that they often aren't necessary and may even be nonsensical.</p>


	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="Example for clarification">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">Don&rsquo;t say</th>
				<th scope="col">Say</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><p>Their claim was totally unrealistic.</p>
					<p>It is particularly difficult to reconcile the somewhat differing views expressed by the management team.</p>
					<p>Total disclosure of all facts is very important to make sure we draw up a total and completely accurate picture of the Agency&rsquo;s financial position.</p></td>
				<td><p>Their claim was absurd.</p>
					<p>It is difficult to reconcile the differing views expressed by the management team.</p>

	<p>Avoid <strong><em>doublets and triplets</em></strong>. English writers love to repeat the same concept by using different words that say the same thing.</p>

	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="Example for clarification">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">Don&rsquo;t say</th>
				<th scope="col">Say</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%">
					<ul style="list-style-type:none; margin-left:0;">
						<li>due and payable</li>
						<li>cease and desist</li>
						<li>knowledge and information</li>
						<li>begin and commence</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
				<td>
					<ul style="list-style-type:none; margin-left:0;">
						<li>due</li>
						<li>stop</li>
						<li>(either one)</li>
						<li>start</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>

	</table>

	<p>Other ways to omit unnecessary words include eliminating hidden verbs, using pronouns, and using active voice. See the guidance on those three topics (<a href="writeNoVerbNouns.cfm">Avoid hidden verbs</a>, <a href="writeYou.cfm">Use pronouns to speak directly to readers</a>, and <a href="writeActive.cfm">Use active voice</a>) for more information.</p>
	<p>Here's an example that uses several of the techniques discussed above to cut a 54 word sentence down to 22 words, with no loss of meaning.</p>

	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="Example for clarification">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">Don&rsquo;t say</th>
				<th scope="col">Say</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%">If the State Secretary finds that an individual has received a payment to which the individual was not entitled, whether or not the payment was due to the individual&rsquo;s fault or misrepresentation, the individual shall be liable to repay to State the total sum of the payment to which the individual was not entitled.</td>
				<td>If the State agency finds that you received a payment that you weren&rsquo;t entitled to, you must pay the entire sum back.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>Omitting excess words can cut documents significantly. Be diligent in challenging every word you write, and eventually you will learn to write not only clearly, but concisely.</p>
