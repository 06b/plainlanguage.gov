While many legal authorities say that contractions don't belong in legal writing, Bryan Garner, a leading authority on legal writing, advocates their use as a way to make legal writing, including opinions and rules, less stuffy and more natural. Contractions make your writing more accessible to the user. Research shows that that they also enhance readability (Danielson and Larosa, 1989).

"Write as you talk" is a common rule of writing readably, and the best way to do that is to use contractions. People are accustomed to hearing contractions in spoken English, and using them in your writing helps people relate to your document.

Use contractions with discretion. Just as you shouldn't bullet everything on a page, you shouldn't make a contraction out of every possible word. Don't use them wherever possible, but wherever they sound natural.
