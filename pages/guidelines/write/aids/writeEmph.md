<p>Use <strong><em>bold and italics</em></strong> to make important concepts stand out. While it is difficult to use these techniques in regulations, emphasis helps bring out important points in other documents. Limit emphasis to important information, otherwise you'll dilute its impact.</p>
<p>PUTTING EVERYTHING IN CAPITAL LETTERS IS NOT A GOOD EMPHASIS TECHNIQUE. ALTHOUGH IT MAY DRAW THE USER'S ATTENTION TO THE SECTION, IT MAKES IT HARDER TO READ. AND IN AN ELECTRONIC ENVIRONMENT IT'S CONSIDERED SHOUTING. <u>Similarly, underlining will draw the user's attention to the section, but it makes it hard to read.</u> Besides, in an electronic environment, people expect underlined text to be a link. <strong><em>It's better to use bold and italics for important issues.</em></strong>
