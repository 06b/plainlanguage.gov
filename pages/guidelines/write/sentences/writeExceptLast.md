title: Place the main idea before exceptions and conditions

	<p>When you start a sentence with an introductory phrase or clause beginning with "except," you almost certainly force the reader to re-read your sentence. You are stating an exception to a rule before you have stated the underlying rule. The audience must absorb the exception, then the rule, and then usually has to go back to grasp the relationship between the two. Material is much easier to follow if you start with the main idea and then cover exceptions and conditions.</p>

	</table>

	<p>In the first version, the audience has to decide whether to jump immediately down to paragraph (b) or continue reading to the end of the sentence. This means the audience is focusing on reading strategy, not on your content.</p>
<p>There is no absolute rule about where to put exceptions and conditions. Put them where they can be absorbed most easily by readers. In general, the main point of the sentence should be as close to the beginning as possible.</p>
<p>Usually use the word <strong><em>if</em></strong> for conditions. Use <strong><em>when</em></strong> (not <strong><em>where</em></strong>), if you need <strong><em>if</em></strong> to introduce another clause or if the condition occurs regularly.</p>
<p>If an exception or condition is just <strong><em>a few words</em></strong>, and seeing it first will avoid misleading users, put it at the beginning instead of the end.</p>

	<p>If an exception or condition is <strong><em>long</em></strong> and the main clause is <strong><em>short</em></strong>, put the main clause first and then state the exception or condition.</p>

	<p>If a condition and the main clause are <strong><em>both long</em></strong>, <em>foreshadow</em> the condition and put it at the end of the sentence. If there are several conditions, lead with "<em>if</em>" or a phrase such as "<em>in the following circumstances</em>."</p>

	<p>Use numbers or letters to designate items in a list if future reference or sequence is important (for example, in a regulation). Otherwise, use bullets.</p>

	<p>Make implied conditions explicit by using <strong>if</strong>.</p>

	<p>Avoid using an exception, if you can, by stating a rule or category directly rather than describing that rule or category by stating its exceptions.</p>
