PLAIN is dedicated to helping federal agencies train their staff to communicate clearly and develop their own plain language programs. We'll train your managers as well.

We offer free, half-day training classes for federal agencies. All of our classes are based on the [Federal Plain Language Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/) and involve interactive writing exercises.

## Class descriptions

### Plain language principles

- Learn how to identify and write for your audience
- Use plain language techniques to create clear and effective writing
- Learn how using plain language can save your agency time and resources

### Manager briefings

- 10–30 minute overview of the Plain Writing Act of 2010
- Assessment of benefits of using plain language

## Request training

We schedule classes on a first-come, first-served basis, depending on trainer availability. Please request training **at least 6 months** in advance.

You must have a .gov or .mil email address to register. [Complete this form](https://goo.gl/forms/fRsKV5i9bwvOTeE73), or [email us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you can’t access Google Apps.

Let us know:

- Which federal agency you work for
- Where your office is located
- Which class you're interested in
- Which month or specific date you'd like the classes (we schedule about 6 months in advance)
- How many federal employees will attend (20–35 people per session is a good number)

After reviewing your request, a training coordinator will email you to set up the details. Please keep in mind that all of our trainers are volunteers. For training outside the DC area, you must pay the trainer's expenses.
