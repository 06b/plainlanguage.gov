## Who we are

The Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) is a group of federal employees from different agencies and specialties who support the use of clear communication in government writing.

Originally called the Plain English Network, PLAIN has been meeting informally since the mid 1990s. Our goal is to promote the use of plain language for all government communications â€” whether they're online or on paper. We believe that using plain language will save federal agencies time and money and provide better service to the American public.

## About the site

This site launched in 1994, and was redesigned in 2004 with volunteers from PLAIN and student work facilitated by [Thom Haller](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bult.2006.1720320411/epdf).

In 2017, we partnered with [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) to redesign the site and make it more accessible in modern browsers. plainlanguage.gov is built with the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/)  and is hosted by [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/).

We are continuing to improve the site and welcome your feedback.
